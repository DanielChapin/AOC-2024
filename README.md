# AOC 2024

I don't have any particular goals for this year - just gonna try to use a variety of different techniques/languages/resources.

## Inputs

I have supplied example (ie. `ex1.txt`) and problem inputs (`in.txt`) for all the problems.
I'm torn between whether or not to include them, but I want the repo to work as-is so I've decided to add them.
